Hi Everyone!
  </p>
  <p>
Welcome to the backstage of the MegaRPI project leading the Bobo movement!
  </p>
  <p>
We are a number of students and faculty members from the Free University of
Bolzano (FUB), which can be found in the sunny valleys of South Tyrol in
northern most Italy.
  </p>
  <p>

  <p>
We have an international team, which is led by
<strong>Pekka Abrahamsson</strong> who is our ex-professor and ex-dean of the
faculty of computer science. Pekka’s origins are in Finland. The other team
members are <strong>Nick Preda</strong>, <strong>Lorenzo Miori</strong>,
<strong>Julian Sanin</strong> and <strong>Matteo Angriman</strong> who are
students at FUB. Nick and Lorenzo are working on the software implementation
while Matteo drives the shooting of educational movies on Raspberry Pis. Julian
on the other hand will magically connect the rack to the satellite! Special
technical expertise is offered by a Trento based IT-specialist
<strong>Lorenzo Nicolodi</strong>. We have a splendid rack design team. The
second generation rack innovation was designed with great inspiration by our
design students <strong>Karim Hamily</strong> and
<strong>Sara Bugoloni</strong>. The Bobo design was led by an industrial
designer <strong>Angelo Ventura</strong> who comes from Bolzano. Our cool look
and feel for the new Bobo innovation comes from our Mexican originated designer
<strong>Naomi Mastachi</strong>. Our scientific research team’s inspirational
source is the database professor <strong>Sven Helmer</strong>. The PhD student
<strong>Nattakarn Phaphoom</strong> strives to complete her PhD on cloud
computing and participates as well. Finally, <strong>Xiaofeng Wang</strong>
from our research team is our great supporter driving us to great science! In
addition, we are receiving generous help from the technical experts in the
University without which these types of projects are impossible to execute. The
project is executed in tight collaboration with the faculties of design &amp;
arts and computer science demonstrating the great environment and atmosphere
where we work.

Few words about the project. The aim of the project is to build a Cloud
Computing Cluster from the scratch with a number of key qualities as the
drivers. First and foremost, the Cluster should be
<strong>easily affordable</strong> to acquire. In practice this means something
around the cost of a MacBook Pro. Any school, institution, company and a private
person should afford to buy it. As a cluster, a single instance of a cluster
should carry <strong>enough capacity</strong> for the use in education, research
and services. Physically, the cluster should be <strong>easily movable</strong>
and it should be <strong>small sized</strong>. The rack design
<strong>must stand time</strong>, be <strong>appealing</strong> and foremost it
should be <strong>fit-for-the-purpose</strong>. Therefore, we place a lot of
attention to the <strong>functionality</strong> of the cluster. To add to this
challenge, the cluster should be <strong>auto-buildable</strong>, so anyone (all
of you!) should be able to build it in less than half a day of work with
material that be easily obtained from a store near you. Materials that are used
should be <strong>ecological</strong> and we systematically avoid using
materials with high carbon footprint (e.g. plastic). As a solution of this third
generation rack design, we have introduced in our pages the “Bobo”, which
carries all of the above characteristics.

  <p>
Technically, we are following the latest technology trends in open source based
web development such as bash scripting, python, NFS, Django, PostgreSQL. Global
Bobo Cloud is our newest breakthrough innovation.
