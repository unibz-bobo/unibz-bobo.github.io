The Project
    </a>
  </h2>
  <p>
MegaRPI project is an open-source, open-hardware, open-science project built on
programmable hardware. We are particularly inspired by Raspberry Pi, which is a
credit card sized computer that runs on Linux.
  </p>
  <p>
The principal aim of the project is to build a <strong>Cloud Computing
Cluster</strong> from the scratch with a number of key qualities as the drivers.
First and foremost, the Cluster should be <strong>easily affordable</strong> to
acquire. In practice this means something around the cost of a MacBook Pro. Any
school, institution, company and a private person should afford to buy it. As a
cluster, a single instance of a cluster should carry <strong>enough
capacity</strong> for the use in education, research and services. Physically,
the cluster should be <strong>easily movable</strong> and it should be
<strong>small sized</strong>. The rack design <strong>must stand time</strong>,
be <strong>appealing</strong> and foremost it should be
<strong>fit-for-the-purpose</strong>. Therefore, we place a lot of attention to
the <strong>functionality</strong> of the cluster. To add to this challenge, the
cluster should be <strong>auto-buildable</strong>, so anyone (all of you!)
should be able to build it in less than half a day of work with material that be
easily obtained from a store near you. Materials that are used should be
<strong>ecological</strong> and we systematically avoid using materials with
high carbon footprint (e.g. plastic). As a solution of this third generation
rack design, we have introduced in our pages the “Bobo”, which carries all of
the above characteristics.

Introducing Bobo
    </a>
  </h3>
  <p>
The first Raspberry Pi cluster rack built with "great design" principles.
  </p>
  <p>
<strong>Bobo is for educational use.</strong> Every school and university in the
world should have one. Students learn how cloud computing operates in practice
and can simulate all the operations performed by a cloud infra provider such as
Amazon for example. Students can experiment, innovate and learn. The future of
computing in a box is Bobo!
  </p>
  <p>
<strong>Bobo is for research use.</strong> Researchers interested practical
aspects of cloud computing and services will benefit for having 100% control on
their experimental setting. Researchers striving to solve the problems in
distributed computing will also benefit widely on Bobo due to ability to build
real life experimental settings with hundreds and thousands of Raspberry Pis on
a global Bobo network.
  </p>
  <p>
<strong>Bobo is for business use.</strong> Bobo will offer a stable IT-service
infrastructure for areas with harsh conditions. The aim is to power the Bobo
with solar energy and connect it to the Internet via satellite connection. First
experiments in this directions are already under way. This offers lucrative
opportunities for many companies.
